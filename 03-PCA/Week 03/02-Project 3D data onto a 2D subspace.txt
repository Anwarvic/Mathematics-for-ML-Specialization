Q1) For a vector x = [6, 0, 0] and the subspace U spanned by the basis vectors b1 = [1, 1, 1] and b2 = [0, 1, 2], which of the following statements are true?
You can use the formula slide that comes with the corresponding lecture.
A1) - The projection of x onto U is [5, 2, -1]
	- The coordinates of the projected point with respect to b1, b2 are [5, -3]
	- The projection matrix is 1/6[[5, 2, -1], [2, 2, 2], [-1, 2, 5]]
	- The projection matrix is symmetric.

Q2) Project [3, 2, 2] onto the subspace spanned by [1, 0, 0] and [0, 1, 1]. You can use the formula slide that comes with the corresponding lecture.
A2) [3, 2, 3]

Q3) (1) Project [12, 0, 0] onto the subspace U_1 spanned by [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 2].
	(2) Project the result from (1) onto the subspace spanned by [-10*sqrt(6), -4*sqrt(6), 2*sqrt(6)]. What is the final projection?
	Hint: For step (2) you do not necessarily need to compute anything.
	You can use the formula slide that comes with the corresponding lecture.
A3) [10, 4, -2]
