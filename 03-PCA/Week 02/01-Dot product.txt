Q1) Compute the length of x = [1, -1, 3] using the dot product. Do the exercises using pen and paper.
A1) sqrt(11)

Q2) Compute the angle (in rad) between x = [3, 4] and y = [1, −1] using the dot product.
A2) 2.9997

Q3) Compute the distance between x = [3, 4] and y = [1, −1] using the dot product. Do the exercises using pen and paper. Enter your answer as a decimal number (calculator is fine to get it).
A3) 5.39

Q4) Write a piece of code that computes the length of a given vector x.
A4) length_x = np.sqrt(np.sum(x**2))

Q5) We are given two vectors x=[1, 2, 3], y=[-1, 0, 8]. Compute the angle (in rad) between x and x-y.
Do the exercises using pen and paper, but you will need a calculator at some point.
A5) 0.704
