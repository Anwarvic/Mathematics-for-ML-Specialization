Q1) What is the variance of the following dataset? D= {1, 2, 3, 2}
Please use decimal numbers in your answer.
A1) 0.5

Q2) What is the standard deviation of the dataset D={1,2,3,2} which we already used in the previous question? You should provide a decimal number as your answer.
A2) 0.707

Q3) What would be the new variance if we added 1 to each element in the dataset D={1,2,3,2} from Question 1? Please use decimal numbers in your answer.
A3) 0.5

Q4) What would be the new variance if we multiplied each sample in a dataset D by 2.
A4) The variance of the new dataset will be four times the variance of \mathcal DD.

Q5) Assuming we have mean x_{n−1}ˉ  and variance σ_{n−1}^2 for some dataset D_n−1 with n−1 samples. What would be the variance σ_n^2 if we add a new element x∗ to the dataset (assuming you have computed the new sample mean x_nˉ?
A5) σ_n^2 = n-1/n *​	σ_{n−1}^2 + 1/n (x∗ - x_{n-1}ˉ) (x∗ - x_{n}ˉ)
