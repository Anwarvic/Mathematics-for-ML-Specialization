Q1) In this assessment, you will be tested on all of the different topics you have in covered this module. Good luck!
A ship travels with velocity given by [1, 2], with current flowing in the direction given by [1, 1] with respect to some co-ordinate axes.
What is the velocity of the ship in the direction of the current?
A1) [3/2, 3/2]

Q2) A ball travels with velocity given by [2, 1], with wind blowing in the direction given by [3, âˆ’4] with respect to some co-ordinate axes.
What is the size of the velocity of the ball in the direction of the wind?
A2) 2/5

Q3) Given vectors v=[-4, -3, 8],  b1=[1, 2, 3], b2=[-2, 1, 0], and b3=[-3, -6, 5] all written in the standard basis, what is v in the basis defined by b1, b2 and b3?  You are given that b1, b2 and b3  are all pairwise orthogonal to each other.
A3) [1, 1, 1]

Q4) Are the following vectors linearly independent?
a=[1, 2, -1], b=[3, -4, 5] and c=[1, -8, 7]
A4) No

Q5) At 12:00 pm, a spaceship is at position [3, 2, 4] km away from the origin with respect to some 3 dimensional co ordinate system. The ship is travelling with velocity [-1, 2, 3] km/h
What is the location of the spaceship after 2 hours have passed?
A5) [1, 6, -2]
