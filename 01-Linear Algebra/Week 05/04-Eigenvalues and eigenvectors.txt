Q1) This assessment will test your ability to apply your knowledge of eigenvalues and eigenvectors to some special cases.
Use the following code blocks to assist you in this quiz. They calculate eigenvectors and eigenvalues respectively:
To practice, select all eigenvectors of the matrix, A = [[4, -5, 6], [7, -8, 6], [3/2, -1/2, -2]]
A1) - [-3, -3, -1]
	- [-2/sqrt(9), -2/sqrt(9), 1/sqrt(9)]
	- [1/2, -1/2, -1]

Q2) Recall from the PageRank notebook, that in PageRank, we care about the eigenvector of the link matrix, LL, that has eigenvalue 1, and that we can find this using power iteration method as this will be the largest eigenvalue.
PageRank can sometimes get into trouble if closed-loop structures appear. A simplified example might look like this,

With link matrix, L = [[0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0]]
Use the calculator in Q1 to check the eigenvalues and vectors for this system.
What might be going wrong in using power iteration to find the principal eigenvector? Select all that apply.
A2) - Other eigenvalues are not small in magnitude compared to 1, and so do not decay away with each power iteration.
	- Because of the loop, Procrastinating Pats that are browsing will go around in a cycle rather than settling on a webpage.

Q3) The loop in the previous question is a situation that can be remedied by damping.
If we replace the link matrix with the damped, L2=[[0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.7], [0.7, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1], [0.1, 0.7, 0.1, 0.1], [0.1, 0.1, 0.7, 0.1]], how does this help? (Check the new eigenvalues)
A3) - The magnitude of the other eigenvalues get smaller.
	- There is now a probability to move to any website.

Q4) Another issue that may come up, is if there are disconnected parts to the internet. Take this example,
https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/MBFZMu8eEee0NxKvr-H_gA_4eaa9edab8bb451eaf5122c0526d54c9_disconnect.png?expiry=1552521600000&hmac=quo3ZW_ly1fOYExoAU4ntVpDkokiduWRAMbIXKMpoZU
with link matrix, L=[[0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0]] 
This form is known as block diagonal, as it can be split into square blocks along the main diagonal, i.e., L=[[M1, 0], [0, M2]]], with M1=M2=[[0, 1], [1, 0]] in this case.
What is happening in this system?
A4) - There are two eigenvalues of 1.
	- There isn't a unique PageRank.

Q5) By similarly applying damping to the link matrix from the previous question. What happens now?
A5) None of the other options.

Q6) Given the matrix A =[[3/2, −1], [−1/2, 1/2]], calculate its characteristic polynomial.
A6) λ^2 − 2λ + 1/4

Q7) By solving the characteristic polynomial above or otherwise, calculate the eigenvalues of the matrix A=[[3/2, −1], [−1/2, 1/2]]
A7) λ1 = 1 − sqrt(3)/2,
	λ2 = 1 + sqrt(3)/2
​
Q8) Select the two eigenvectors of the matrix A = [[3/2, -1], [-1/2, 1/2]]
A8) v1 = [-1-sqrt(3), 1]
	v2 = [-1+sqrt(3), 1]

Q9) Form the matrix CC whose left column is the vector v1 and whose right column is v2 from immediately above.
By calculating D = C^{-1}.A.C or by using another method, find the diagonal matrix D.
A9) [[1+sqrt(3)/2, 0], [0, 1-sqrt(3)/2]]

Q10) By using the diagonalisation above or otherwise, calculate A^2
A10) [[11/4, -2], [-1, 3/4]]
