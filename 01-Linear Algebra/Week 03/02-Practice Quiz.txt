Q1) You go to the shops on Monday and buy 1 apple, 1 banana, and 1 carrot; the whole transaction totals €15. On Tuesday you buy 3 apples, 2 bananas, 1 carrot, all for €28. Then on Wednesday 2 apples, 1 banana, 2 carrots, for €23.
Construct a matrix and vector for this linear algebra system. That is, for
A[a, b, c] = [S_Mon, S_Tue, S_Wed]
Where a, b, c, are the prices of apples, bananas, and carrots. And each ss is the total for that day.
Fill in the components of A and s
A1) A = [[1, 1, 1],
	     [3, 2, 1],
	     [2, 1, 2]]
s = [15, 28, 23]

Q2) Given another system, Br=t
