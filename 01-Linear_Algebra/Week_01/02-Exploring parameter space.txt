A1) - There are at least 15 elements in the frequency vector, \mathbf{f}f.
    - If another sample was taken under the same conditions, the frequencies would be broadly similar.
    - The total area of all the bins sums to one.

A2) =[ 155
       12​]

A3) Graph (1)

A4) - Keep the standard deviation, σ, approximately the same.
    - Increase the mean μ.

A5) μ = 178 ; σ = 7.5 -> 0.000475
	p = [178, 7.5]

A6) - Moving at right angles to contour lines in the parameter space will have the greatest effect on the fit than moving in other directions.
    - Each point on the surface represents a set of parameters p}=[μ, σ]

A7) Δp=[−2, 2]
