    "# Fitting the distribution of heights data\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assessment you will write code to perform a steepest descent to fit a Gaussian model to the distribution of heights data that was first introduced in *Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is the same as you encountered in *Gradient descent in a sandpit* but this time instead of descending a pre-defined function, we shall descend the $\\chi^2$ (chi squared) function which is both a function of the parameters that we are to optimise, but also the data that the model is to fit to.\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "If we have data for the heights of people in a population, it can be plotted as a histogram, i.e., a bar chart where each bar has a width representing a range of heights, and an area which is the probability of finding a person with a height in that range.\n",
    "We can look to model that data with a function, such as a Gaussian, which we can specify with two parameters, rather than holding all the data in the histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gaussian function is given as,\n",
    "$$f(\\mathbf{x};\\mu, \\sigma) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\mathbf{x} - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure above shows the data in orange, the model in magenta, and where they overlap in green.\n",
    "This particular model has not been fit well - there is not a strong overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the videos the definition of $\\chi^2$ as the squared difference of the data and the model, i.e $\\chi^2 = |\\mathbf{y} - f(\\mathbf{x};\\mu, \\sigma)|^2$. This is represented in the figure as the sum of the squares of the pink and orange bars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't forget that $\\mathbf{x}$ an $\\mathbf{y}$ are represented as vectors here, as these are lists of all of the data points, the |*abs-squared*|${}^2$ encodes squaring and summing of the residuals on each bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the fit, we will want to alter the parameters $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$, and ask how that changes the $\\chi^2$.\n",
    "That is, we will need to calculate the Jacobian,\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{J} = \\left[ \\frac{\\partial ( \\chi^2 ) }{\\partial \\mu} , \\frac{\\partial ( \\chi^2 ) }{\\partial \\sigma} \\right]\\;. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the first term, $\\frac{\\partial ( \\chi^2 ) }{\\partial \\mu}$, using the multi-variate chain rule, this can be written as,\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial ( \\chi^2 ) }{\\partial \\mu} = -2 (\\mathbf{y} - f(\\mathbf{x};\\mu, \\sigma)) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\mu}(\\mathbf{x};\\mu, \\sigma)$$\n",
    "With a similar expression for $\\frac{\\partial ( \\chi^2 ) }{\\partial \\sigma}$; try and work out this expression for yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jacobians rely on the derivatives $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\mu}$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\sigma}$.\n",
    "Write functions below for these."
