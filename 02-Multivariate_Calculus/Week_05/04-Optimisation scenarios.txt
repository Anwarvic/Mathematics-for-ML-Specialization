A1) - Starting point 1
    - Starting point 3
    - Starting point 4

A2) - Starting point 3
    - Starting point 4
    - Starting point 5

A3) Starting point 2

A4) The global minimum is in a wide and flat basin, so convergence is slow

A5) The algorithm is passing either side of a saddle point.

A6) The Jacobian at the starting point is very large.
