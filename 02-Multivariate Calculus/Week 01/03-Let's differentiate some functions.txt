Q1) In the following quiz, you will practice how to differentiate some basic functions. Some questions look tricky, but just stick to the rules you know!
Differentiate the function f(x) = x^3 + x^2 /3 +3
A1) 3x^2 + 2/3 x

Q2) What function would differentiate to get f'(x) = \frac{3\pi x^4}{4} + 11x^2 + \sqrt{2}f
A2) f(x) = \frac{3\pi x^5}{20} + \frac{11x^3}{3} + \sqrt{2}x + 2

Q3) When given distance as a function of time (that is, distance = x = x(t), one can calculate the rate of change of distance (that is, speed) as a function of time by differentiating x(t) with respect to t.
Similarly, one can calculate the rate of change of speed (that is, acceleration) by differentiating x'(t) (the speed) with respect to t, to get the "double derivative" of x(t).
Consider a ball being thrown from a plane in the sky. At time t=0, has a distance from the ground of 10,000 m, has speed equal to 0 ms^-1, and has acceleration equal to -9.8ms^-2. Assuming that acceleration is constant, which of the following functions x(t) best describes the distance from the ground to the ball as a function of time?
A3) x(t)=−4.9t^2 +10,000

Q4) Differentiate the function f(x) = x^3 + \frac{x^2}{3} +3 and evaluate the differential at x=5.
A4) f′(5)= 235/3
​
Q5) Differentiate the function f(x) = x^3 + 27x^2 -5x +9f and evaluate the differential at x=-1.
A5) f′(−1)=−56
