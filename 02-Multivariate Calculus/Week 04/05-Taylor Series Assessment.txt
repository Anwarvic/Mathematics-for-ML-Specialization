Q1) Now that we have completed the set of Taylor series lectures and answered all the quiz questions, we now need to test our understanding of Taylor series. We have looked at the derivation of Taylor series, broken it down into a power series approximation, explored special cases and developed the idea of multivariant Taylor series, that is required in order for us to develop a good grounding for the next chapters in this course.
For the function f(x) = x sin(x) shown below, determine what order approximation is shown by the orange curve, where the Taylor series approximation was centered about x = 0.

A2) f(x) = 1 + 3x + 0.5x^2 + 1/24 * x^4

Q3) The graph below shows the discontinuous function f(x) = \frac{2}{(x^2 - x)}. Approximate the section of this function that covers the domain 0 < x < 1. Use the Taylor series forumla and x=0.5 as your starting point, find the first two non zero terms.
